  "summary": "The diff makes multiple backend/frontend code and UI changes and adds a redeploy trigger file, but it does not show an actual production redeploy nor does it output a single new live production URL as required.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Trigger a full rebuild and redeploy of the current application to production, and output the newly generated live production URL after deployment completes.",
      "reason": "The diff contains no evidence of an executed production deployment or any produced/copy-pastable production URL. The only redeploy-related artifact is a text file indicating a trigger time/nonce, not a deployment result or URL.",

    {
      "description": "Substantial backend feature/data changes (delivery orders, rider profiles/applications, site content initialization, rate logic, authorization/storage mixins, etc.).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly says no code changes are required and lists non-goals including backend feature changes and data model/state changes; yet backend/main.mo is heavily modified with new/expanded types and logic.",
